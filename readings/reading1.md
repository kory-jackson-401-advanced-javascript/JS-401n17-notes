## Common Mistakes in an Interview

1. In a rush
    * Slow down, take your time when figuring out the problem
    * Resist the urge to code

2. Keep it simple
    * Don't put too much thought into the first line of code

## Your time is money

1. Work like you make $1,000/hr
    * Stop wasting your time
    * You should be utilizing your time to better your goals in life
    * Don't make an excuse that you're busy, it takes more strength to not be busy with useless things...
        * Don't be _busy_ be _focused_
    * Be in charge of your time, don't let it slip away
2. Busyness and Stress are the Enemy
    * Making yourself busy is a sign of procrastination
    * Stop making the excuse that you need to be **busy** in order to get the job done
    * Have set times to stay focused, that way you can get a good quantity of quality work done in a short period...
        * More focused work means less efforts over a short period of time
